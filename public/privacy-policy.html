  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Options Trade Tracker ("the App") is a personal portfolio tracking tool that helps users
    manage and analyze their options trading positions. This privacy policy explains how the App
    handles your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App collects and stores the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trade Data:</strong> Options trade information that you manually enter into the App,
        including symbols, dates, prices, and position details.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> If you choose to enable Google Sheets sync,
        the App accesses your Google account to read and write data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet
        that you own. We only access the specific spreadsheet created by the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Schwab Account Information:</strong> If you choose to connect your Schwab brokerage account,
        the App accesses read-only position data to display current market values. We do not access
        your full account number, cannot place trades, and cannot transfer funds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display and analyze your options trading positions</li>
    <li>To sync your data across devices via Google Sheets (optional feature)</li>
    <li>To calculate profit/loss and other portfolio metrics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your trade data is stored locally in your web browser's
        localStorage. This data never leaves your device unless you enable Google Sheets sync.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets:</strong> If you enable sync, your data is stored in a Google Sheets
        spreadsheet in your own Google Drive account. You maintain full ownership and control of this data.</li>
    <li><strong>Schwab Tokens:</strong> If you connect Schwab, authentication tokens are stored locally
        in your browser's localStorage. Position data is fetched on-demand and cached temporarily in
        your browser only - it is never stored on external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. Your trade data
    remains entirely under your control, stored either locally in your browser or in your personal
    Google Drive account.
  </p>

  <h2>Google API Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses Google API Services to provide optional cloud sync functionality. Our use and
    transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
    including the Limited Use requirements.
  </p>
  <p>Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We only request access to Google Sheets and Google Drive to create and manage a single
        spreadsheet for storing your trade data.</li>
    <li>We do not use Google user data for advertising purposes.</li>
    <li>We do not share Google user data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Schwab API Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses the Schwab Trader API to provide optional real-time position values. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication - your Schwab password is never seen by the App.</li>
    <li>We only request read-only access to view your positions and their market values.</li>
    <li>We cannot place trades, transfer money, or access your full account number.</li>
    <li>You can revoke access at any time through the App settings or your Schwab account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    The App runs entirely in your web browser. We do not operate servers that store your data.
    Authentication with Google and Schwab is handled securely through OAuth 2.0 systems - we never
    see or store your passwords.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can view all stored data in your browser's developer tools (localStorage)</li>
    <li>You can delete your local data by clearing your browser's localStorage</li>
    <li>You can revoke Google access at any time through your Google Account settings</li>
    <li>You can delete the Google Sheets spreadsheet from your Google Drive at any time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page
    with an updated "Last updated" date.
  </p>
